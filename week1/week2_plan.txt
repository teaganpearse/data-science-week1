WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: Teagan
Date: 05/02/2026

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [string-related inconsistencies (capitalisation, typos)]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [3 / Strings]

Which variable(s) affected: [body_mass_mg / site / treatment]

Why this is important to fix: [to ensure data is consistent and can be analysed accurately]

What I plan to do: 
use the stringr package to clean text.


ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [biological impossibilities in the body mass variable]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [7 / Check Data Consistency]

Which variable(s) affected: [body_mass_mg]


Why this is important to fix: [ensure all data is accurate and can be analysed effectively]

What I plan to do: [carry out basic range checks to check data consistency, filter data to identify impossible values, visual inspection, flag impossible observations] 



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - will address later if time] [NA/missing values]
- [Issue 4 - uncertain how to handle]
