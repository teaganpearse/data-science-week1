TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [ ] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [ ] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: ___________
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 
   - 
   - 
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 
   - 
   - 


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [ ] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: ___________
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 
   - 
   - 
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 
   - 
   - 


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   (e.g., "01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY")
   
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: ___________ | Percent missing: _____%
   Variable: ___________ | Percent missing: _____%
   Variable: ___________ | Percent missing: _____%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [ ] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [ ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have?

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ ] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [ ] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________

================================================================================
TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ ] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: ___________
   
   Minimum value: _____  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: _____  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [ ] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related (e.g., body length and body mass,
   sex and reproductive status, species and location):

   Variable 1: ___________
   Variable 2: ___________
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [ ] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [ ] Convert one variable to NA (which one? _________)
   [ ] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
